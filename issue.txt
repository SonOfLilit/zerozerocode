Hey there, hope you're doing well. I've noticed a strange issue which seems to occur in certain circumstances. The library switches my Calibri font in the following spreadsheet to Arial upon loading and saving the file. I created the file in ONLYOFFICE.

Here's the workbook: fonts.xlsx

And the code used to round-trip:

fn main() {
    let book = umya_spreadsheet::reader::xlsx::read("fonts.xlsx").unwrap();
    umya_spreadsheet::writer::xlsx::write(&book, "output.xlsx").unwrap();
}
And the output file: output.xlsx

As you'll see when opening it, the font has been changed to Arial instead of being retained as Calibri.

Cheers
Fotis
