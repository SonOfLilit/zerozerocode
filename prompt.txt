Debug and fix this issue:

{issue}

Plan out loud a few steps ahead before you start doing things. Follow your plan to the end unless there's a reason to change it, and if you do, plan a new plan out loud.
Make sure to add tests for any issues found and to run tests before committing.
The program to fix is in a git repo in the current directory.
You can run commands in a bash cli through tool use. Use this to find your way around the project, read code, experiment with solutions, etc'.
You can use `sed` for viewing and editing files from the terminal (e.g. `sed -n '1,20p' file.rs` to view lines 1-20 of `file.rs`). Conserve context by using `sed` judiciously instead of viewing complete long files. If you're lost, use `pwd` and `ls` to find your bearings.
